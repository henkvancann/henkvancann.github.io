  I'm not a programmer but I create documentation and educational resources. 
  My Github user page is specifying what the teams I work mean when we say:
  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Autonomic Identifiers (AID), KERI, OOBI, CESR, and ACDC.
  Blockchain Commons, Trust-over-IP, Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) and DIF are among
  my favorite organization to donate to.
