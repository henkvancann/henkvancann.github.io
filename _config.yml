  I'm not a programmer but I can read code and consequently have an opinion.
  I create documentation and educational resources in teams of expert developers. 
  My Github user page explains the often forked repos of the teams I work in, 
  and I try to add what we mean when we say
  Issuer, Controller, Validator, Verifier, Proof, Root-of-trust, etc. and more in general:
  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Autonomic Identifiers (AID), `KERI`, `OOBI`, `CESR`, and `ACDC`.
  Blockchain Commons, Trust-over-IP, Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) and DIF are among
  my favorite organization to donate to.
