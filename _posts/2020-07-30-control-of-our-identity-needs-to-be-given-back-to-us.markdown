# “Control of our identity needs to be given back to us”

It is very rare to hear managers and politicians talk about the importance of digital identity being kept free and personally controlled. When this happens, we should be grateful and be supportive of these ambassadors and, above all, take good notice of how they reach their audience.

Mr. Rob van Gijzel, Chairman of the Intelligent Community Forum Foundation, representative of the *Dutch Blockchain Coalition* in relation to the Dutch government, former mayor of Eindhoven and member of the Dutch parliament, *recently put it this way* during the online DBC conference last month:

“Something very important about **personal identity** is happening now.

The right to a personal identity was established through the French revolution: you became someone, you got a name. And, based on this identity, you had the power to engage in contracts, to recognise each other. Your rights were established by law.

**But now we see that these individual rights have been reduced and threatened through digital developments in the world.** In China, an individual’s identity is managed by the government; it knows everything about the people and sees everything that people do.

In the United States, the same thing happens through commercial platforms that have completely infiltrated people’s lives with regard to their identity. **For us in Europe, it is so important that we give identity back to people themselves — and that includes our digital identity.**

Identity is vital for the way we organise our society and for who has a say about you. This is one of the main reasons for me personally to get involved with the blockchain here. And yet, we — the Dutch Blockchain Coalition — are also a very large partner of the government because they also have an interest in ensuring and **guaranteeing that control of our identity is given back to us**.”

### **This is really a big statement in favor of open public blockchains and **self-**sovereign identity! It is rare. Too often managers and politicians don’t speak very explicitly about the importance of free digital identity.**

### **Let’s celebrate this. We should be grateful for and supportive of ambassadors like Van Gijzel. And what did he teach us, in passing?**

## What we’ve learned

How to get a topic across that might be perceived as controversial and complex, using accessible language and elegant timing.

1. Mr. van Gijzel doesn’t mention *free and open public blockchains nor self sovereign identity nor personal key management, *though* t*hese are tools that he might need one day for his objectives. Van Gijzel **focuses on the real issue **(freedom and self sovereignty)** **by, firstly, introducing **why this needs to be solved**.

1. He avoids discussion about possibly controversial topics, such as bitcoin or anonymity. Furthermore his basic attitude is cooperative; he likes to work through partnership with, instead of being an opponent of, the state, though it might be seen as the greatest opponent of a free digital identity.

1. Van Gijzel took to the podium to air his clear message in a live online internet session. So his statement couldn’t be edited, cut or put in a different context. He took everyone (including me) by surprise?

Anyway, perhaps it was a deliberate move but it was certainly a disarmingly pure and ardent speech. Well done, Mr. Van Gijzel. Keep up the good work.

A growing group of professionals and volunteers exist who can assist in actually fulfilling the objective of giving us back our digital identity, when sufficient momentum has been achieved. Sponsorship and patronage is needed.

In the meantime, lots of initiatives are in progress on another part of the job that needs to be done — to develop training and open source toolkits to implement the action that Van Gijzel appeals for.

When will sufficient momentum be achieved? When lots of people understand (why) they need to reclaim their digital identity and have it under their own control.
