# Bitcoin purism more effective than maximalism?

This blog post lists some new ideas about how we, bitcoin supporters, could more effectively communicate with the outside world. The reason for writing is that there is no label imposed upon me into which I fit nicely. I suggest the name ‘Purism’ for the bundle of partially deviant ideas with regard to ‘maximalism’. This text is written for insiders in the field of open public blockchains and its applications.

**Have you read?**

* Mastering bitcoin — Antonopoulos

* The bitcoin standard — Ammous

**No?** *Then some of what I argue below might be difficult to follow. *What is bitcoin and how does it work — [watch an introductory video](http://www.bitcoinproperly.org/), watch many [presentations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ) of Andreas Antonopoulos on Youtube, study the site of [Jameson Lopp](https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html) and /or the recommended reading of books above.

**Are you a bitcoin *maximalist* and believer? ***Then some of what I argue below might be difficult to follow.* But please give it a try.

## What is maximalism and who invented it?

The Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin did this in his blog post, back in 2014, as a critical note to those people who are single-minded in following and preaching bitcoin principles in, what we now know as, a ‘maximalistic’ way.

But the group Buterin tried to educate, gradually came to love the label ‘maximalism’ and how they were described. They became *proud* to be a maximalist and became determined to behave like one too. And that’s because, according to later interpretation and further study, it would serve a purpose.

### Honeybadger 2018 and HCPP 2018

I visited the Honeybadger conference in Riga and HCPP in Prague. Both vibrant congresses with lots of like-minded people discussing progress in the bitcoin and privacy field. At both congresses the voice of the maximalists was present, and pretty loud. No offence taken, because I agree with a lot of the maximalistic principles.

Giacomo Zucco was a speaker and is a self proclaimed maximalist who deduced four universals truths from ten general principles that apply to our common line of work.

His presentation in Riga was a bit ironic and humorous in a way, well done. But as far as I perceived from the live presentation and later the [footage](https://view.ly/v/W7tm8Eb2cH9x), Zucco is dead serious about the message: only bitcoin counts, the rest of the crypto currencies are scams and the people behind them are either a scammer, stupid and/or ignorant and as a maximalist you should not be nice to the rest of the world (because that attitude serves a purpose too). It is a strong bonding opinion in a so far very successful group, that spreads the message: ‘You’re either with us, or against us.’

In Riga the deduction of ten principles led to four ‘universal truths’.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3172/1*Ey00ItqzdtdJnyMD2ZRtxQ.png)

And that is where he lost me. I have a quite different opinion, based on the same principles.

Besides their own category, *Maximalists* have invented the groups ‘*no-coiners*’ and ‘*multi-coiners*’. I don’t accept being put into any of these three categories. A category for me is missing. I kept studying and contemplating and created a fourth category: *purist*.

## Similarities and a sort of homecoming

A congress with lots of early adopters in the bitcoin field truly is a sort of homecoming. Talking to people you‘ve never met before could easily feel like they’ve gone through the same high school in the same village where you grew up. It is a strong bond. And a strong group identity like that might easily turn into:

* We are backing the right cause, others don’t understand us! (which I believe is true)

* We are the chosen ones, we should spread the word of innovation and disruption (the latter part of which I believe is true)

* We are always right

* Us against the rest of the world

## Group identity

To describe the bitcoin-supporting group identity, we have already had smart and eloquent people deducing, speaking out and writing down universal truths or principles of the true nature of the bitcoin innovation. A few examples of evergreens, in which I believe — at least 95%:

a. Eighteen building blocks in Mastering Bitcoin of Antonopoulos’ ‘Blockchain applications’, [Chapter 12](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch12.asciidoc), page 275–278

b. Eight criteria in Gideon Greenspan’s article ‘[Avoiding the pointless blockchain project](https://www.the-blockchain.com/2015/12/03/gideon-greenspan-avoiding-the-pointless-blockchain-project-how-to-determine-if-youve-found-a-real-blockchain-use-case/)’.

c. [Crypto-economics](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Cryptoeconomics), Github Libbitcoin, Eric Voskuil

and more recently:

d. [The bitcoin standard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJbcHMnVWvpNLf6b8CHFuO9-qyN_A6hu/view?fbclid=IwAR0Gn8xeccbV9fhODPGACelB7nk99cv2VOmEJxkUhfR7l26R0X8fVpVIeiU), Saifedean Ammous

Important to repeat ‘…in which I believe’. It is my opinion. And your opinion could be different from mine, which I respect.

## Alienated

A few times this year I have felt alienated from the people and innovation I love so much: bitcoin. The reason, in hindsight, was that I could not support the ideology behind bitcoin maximalism. And if you realize you have a deviant opinion on maximalism, then that has serious consequences. It might not be apparent at first. But once you get to know the maximalists’ principles you quickly come to understand that you have to choose.

Maximalism to me, is a polarising form of argumentation, which does not allow the position of neutrality.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uNC8mLRqh7pmF7KrDbFyZA.jpeg)

The fallacy of *binary* reasoning becomes obvious in a famous example. This is the statement of the former US President George W. Bush. After 9/11, at the launch of his anti-terrorism campaign, he said:
> “Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists”

In a tweet, I responded to Giacomo Zucco’ s speech with the words of another speaker at Honeybadger, Andreas Antonopoulos, but from a year earlier, in 2017:

“First, do no harm” (citing [Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates)’ oath)

Andreas is not a maximalist, he’s neutral, as far as I know. He used the sentence “First do no harm” [[link to original footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4F-h4xuXMk&vl=en)] [[link to footage with Dutch subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOZIoVL6yf0)] to argue that the old school financial institutions, governments and multinationals should do no harm to us, adopters of open public blockchains and crypto currencies, us freedom seekers, striving for more privacy and independency and to lead self-providing and more autonomous lives more in harmony with sustainable developments, etc.

So, a year later, I argued in return ‘the bitcoin maximalists community should not do harm to others either, because it will affect our own peers’.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2272/1*C0DSBrRQMqMHvgMC1ImHGg.png)

A few weeks later I argued:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2548/1*8xcFEBYnyjJI3R7DEer5zQ.png)

And although we exchanged some thoughts I wasn’t able to get my point across, which I hope to clarify in this blog post. I named it ‘Purism’ and I hope I’ll find bitcoin-thinking leaders on my side, because it is important to me to come across as friendly and to be effective as a bitcoin believer who gives the gift of his conviction to others.

But first I have to tackle one more *hypothesis*. And that is…

## bitcoin is the hardest money on earth?

In a recent [blog post](https://medium.com/@hasufly/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9?sk=27e8cf65d45c46ffae1466ce2ac31b48) ‘*Unpacking Bitcoin’s Social Contract
A Skeptic’s Guide to Bitcoin: Part II*’ under the heading “Do Bitcoin forks endanger the no-inflation rule?” Hasu states
> “If you wanted to fork Bitcoin — and not have the new network die immediately — you would have to fork the social contract first. You would need to convince as many people as possible that your ruleset is better for them, so they update their rules together with yours.”

I consider that a ‘Yes’ for bitcoin being the hardest money as its supply is limited to 21 million over time. And the other forks will die off, because they lack the social context / contract.

But what about competing crypto currency platforms. Do competitors endanger the no-inflation rule? The answer to this question is most probably ‘yes’ too, because the social contracts of competing crypto currency platforms are different and have widespread support at grass-roots level.

That finding implies that **the outside world**, 99,9% of the world population isn’t aware yet and **will see the bundle of emerging cryptocurrencies as inflational**. They don’t know the difference (yet) between bitcoin, bchabc, bchsv, ethereum, dash, monero and all the other coins/tokens on coinmarketcap.com.

One could argue the bundle of cryptocurrencies, rated as valuable by the outside world, are a *compound* or *composite* **store of value** containing *multiple* cryptocurrencies.

And that’s something true maximalists are going to have to live with? Or not?

### The bitcoin standard

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4CN2Q30YcITcMqVrIdAOWQ.jpeg)

Saifedean Ammous predicts in *The bitcoin standard* that all other cryptocurrencies will undergo the same fate as the metal *silver* did: only the hardest money (gold as a physical asset, and in the digital world bitcoin) will prevail. It is no surprise that Ammous is an icon for maximalists.

Back to what I understood from his deduction in the book: silver lost against gold, and so will all the other cryptos against bitcoin.

Apparently the reasoning holds for physical gold versus silver. The historical price chart of silver is a proof and also the fact that silver is apparently too easy to mine to be considered a hard — or sound — money.

But do we take that *analogy to bitcoin* for granted in the global decentralised digital 24/7 world with **automatic swaps** emerging?? I don’t dare to predict how that game plays out. Until we are there, we need to cooperate, not fight all the other projects that are honest and pure. I’ll get back to how we could measure ‘honest and pure’ later in this article.

We need to accept the same economic reality Ammous urges governments and banks to accept:

bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies have value which are expressed in their individual market price.

I agree with most of Ammous’ great book, but my belief is that there is room for other cryptocurrencies to take part in the world wide compound / composite digital store of value where progress and market price determines mutual value. Hard money, yes, but not as hard as bitcoin alone.

## Open Public Blockchain Purism

### or ‘bitcoin purism’ if you like

A purist is a person who insists on absolute adherence to traditional rules of structure in language or style. But we also see the term used in combination with culture and art (an example is the painting at the beginning). The first time that the term (perhaps accidentally) was used in conjunction with bitcoin was in the title of an article.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4812/1*KZ2JMUkWa0Bz_gjgWvzfIQ.png)

To my surprise the term ‘purists’ is not revisited or explained in the article itself. So that is the opportunity I have taken in this article: to explain purism in the context of fundamental bitcoin knowledge.

In dictionaries *purism* is associated with authenticity, and a purist is in favor of elementary forms and, surprisingly enough, in favor of diversity.

For me the most appealing definition is the one from [Freebase](https://www.definitions.net/definition/purist):
> **“A purist is one who desires that an item remain true to its essence and free from adulterating* or diluting** influences.** The term may be used in almost any field, and can be applied either to the self or to others. Use of the term **may be either pejorative or complimentary**, depending on the context. Because the appellation depends on **subjective notions of what is “pure”** as opposed to “adulterating” as applied to any particular item, conflict can arise both as to whether a person so labeled is actually a purist and as to whether that is desirable. According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, the term dates from 1706 and is defined as “a person who adheres strictly and often excessively to a tradition”, especially “one preoccupied with the purity of a language and its protection from the use of foreign or altered forms.”

* **adulterate** = render (something) poorer in quality by adding another substance.

** **dilute** = make (something) weaker in force, content, or value by modification or the addition of other elements.

I see a few interesting features in this definition when compared to the line of thinking by maximalists. But…

### Why do I need another definition?

Because I sometimes don’t agree with the maximalistic standpoint. I sometimes feel alienated. In a positive sense I think we have to be getting real (“grow up” if you like), be more effective, have more fun with peers in the field, and do less navel gazing.

## Open public Blockchain Purism

Since 99,9% of the world population is not synced with the subject at all, we are all in the same boat. ‘We’ as in: bitcoin, ethereum, dash, litecoin, etc together. The litmus test whether we consider an innovation ‘on our side’ could be a combination of evaluating developments against the principles above (under header ‘Group identity’). That would be a personal assessment based on opinions, but still could form a group of like minded people, *purists* so to say.

### **Different views (as opposed to maximalism)**

Associated developments -> c*ooperation* vs. fighting against

Store of value -> *compound* vs. one winner being bitcoin

Attitude towards others -> *open & respectful* vs. dismissive & judgemental

### **Similar views with maximalism**

Purism has *many similarities with bitcoin maximalism* towards open public blockchains, ICO’s, forks, private chains, and it is no problem to address initiatives out there as being ‘shit coins, scams, idiotic developments’ but there is **a big difference between saying ‘it is a scam’ and saying “you’re a scammer”**.

Don’t call the ***people*** involved ‘scammers’, ‘idiots’, etc. because **it will backfire on you or your peers sooner or later**. It already has many times, for example, with the recent inflation bug in bitcoin and its forks. Although the bug was discovered by a developer in the Bitcoin Cash community and reported back privately to the bitcoin core team (kudos!!), the shit hit the fan when the result of year-long maximalistic behavior surfaced: the bitcoin core developers were fried by the outside world. A [well-known](https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm) saying is
> You reap what you sow

The bitcoin community couldn’t even utter ‘sorry, we fucked up, but we’re all responsible, not only bitcoin devs, but it’s open source, so all bitcoin users, all devs at forks, all users of forks…’

What if they had appealed to the shared interest outside the bitcoin community? Normally that is a good thing to happen. But most probably the opponents, working for the other projects, would have fried the bitcoin core developers: *“You usually think you’re so fantastic, and now you need US to take responsibility for YOUR f… up?!”*

The reason to expect so **little respite**, I think, is that the loud, explicit, eloquent, maximalistic part of our bitcoin community had “invested” in such a treatment as a response to calling colleagues idiots, scammers and losers. What do you expect back when you make a mistake yourself eventually?

Why should you care about your reputation as a maximalist?

## The 7 habits of highly successful people

This is the title of a 25+ year old book of wisdom. It has a [full fledged wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People).

In relation to the discussion above it introduces the notion of an emotional bank account that all human beings have. Young, old, privately, or business-wise: we have to nurture our emotional bank account. I can’t go into the details but you might recognize a few habits of maximalists in the *withdrawals* part of the extract that is directly derived from Steven R. Covey’s book.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4496/1*Ocz-Ck1uTvBdvS53SACQoA.png)

With purism you would *deposit* into the emotional bank account of people enthusiastically working on other projects, *without denying* your beliefs that bitcoin is the best, the hardest money, etc.

## Purism might be more effective

To build a bridge to four universal truths of bitcoin maximalism by Zucco, I would like to rephrase them in a more puristic way:

I. Everything which is not bitcoin *could still be* a **pure and honest coin**,

II. Every attempt at changing bitcoin *could still be* a **meaningful peer innovation**

III. Every pushy manoeuvre to spend bitcoin *could still be* a **useful check out of funds**

IV. We *should be* nice and supportive to **pure associated projects**

These four bullet points are also a way to measure the level of honesty and pureness of projects. How to build bridges between projects that score well on the one hand and bitcoin on the other? -> I don’t have a clue yet. Maybe we should just start spreading the word. Thanks for reading!
